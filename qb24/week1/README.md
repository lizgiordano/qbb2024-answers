# exercise 1 

# step 1.1
num_reads = (1000000*3)/100 = 30,000 reads

# step 1.4
# 1 how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)? 
    48112
# 2 How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
    It matches the Poisson well, but the normal distribution fits the data better. 

# Step 1.5 
# In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
    98
# How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
    It matches the Poisson. The normal distribution fits the data.
    
# Step 1.6
# In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
    8
# How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
    It matches Poisson, and the normal distribution fits.

 To accurately reconstruct the sequence of the genome it would take sequencing longer reads.
