# Step 2.3 Draw conclusions from plot
# 1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell?
exons because it has the lowest enrichment. Purifying selection decreases genetic variation and exons have lowest amounts of SNPs
# 2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 
Selective pressure. As the generations continue, harmful mutations will probably be selected against. So as MAF increases there will be less SNPs will be less enriched.
# 3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
Yes they make sense because I would expect conding regions to be under stronger selective pressure than noncoding regions.
